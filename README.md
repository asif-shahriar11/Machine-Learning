Machine learning projects.

- `Adaptive Boosting`: Implemented from scratch. Uses Logistic Regression as a weak learner. Performance is evaluated on the Telco dataset, Credit card dataset and Adult dataset from Kaggle. Note: the datasets are zipped.
- `FNN`: Feed-forward Neural Network implemented from scratch. Performance is evaluated using the EMNIST dataset (digits identification).
